## Fixing automatic binding errors

Looking at the Xamarin-SDK repository `ApiDefinition.cs` and `Structs.cs` you can gather some info on how to fix the code generated by sharpie.

- Everything is nested inside a 
```c#
namespace NearIT {
    ...
}
```
- All methods with a [Verify(MethodToProperty)] are usually generated correctly, we can comment the line.
- All [Verify(ConstantsInterfaceAssociation)] blocks are ususally generated correctly, so we can comment the line
- All (except for the first) definitions of `Constants` will warn. We can comment out [Static] for all of them.
- Some methods will not build because the return value will not be compatible with `TValue` or some error like that. In that case add 
```c#
: INativeObject
```
to the definition of that object in the `ApiDefinitions.cs`.

- Some classes implementing protocols will apear to implement a version of the protocol that starts with **I** like **INITValidating**, this can be edited to **NITValidating**
- Some methods with `{ get; }` will complain, they might be fixed with `()` instead of `{ get; }`
